# Social Media Impact Analysis for Food Safety Security Organizations

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for a research project aimed at enhancing social media impact for food safety security organizations. The project focuses on understanding text tone preferences based on user demographics using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Collection
- Raw data obtained from a survey consisting of demographic information and user preferences for text tonality.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaning, encoding, and feature engineering tasks to prepare the dataset for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- In-depth exploration of the dataset, including descriptive statistics, distribution of tonality preferences, and identification of patterns.

### 4. Clustering Analysis
- Application of hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify significant patterns among different demographic groups.

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation
- Building machine learning models to predict tonality preferences based on demographic features.

### 6. Results and Insights
- Summary of findings, including distinct tonality preferences within demographic clusters.
