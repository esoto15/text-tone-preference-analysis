# Enhancing Social Media Impact: Leveraging User Demographics for Text Tone Preference Analysis

## Abstract
This study investigates the correlation between user demographics and text tone preferences for social media content aimed at addressing food insecurity among Hispanic households in the United States. Using k-means and hierarchical clustering machine learning models, we analyze preliminary data collected from a research group comprising mentors and students who tested the survey framework. By developing various text tone connotations, we aim to uncover patterns in post preferences among the Hispanic community. Our findings will assist food pantries in crafting more engaging and effective social media content.
